# Municipal DAO

> **Part of the MBTQ Deaf Accessibility Ecosystem**

## The Journey:  From Idea to Ecosystem

1. **Build** - Create deaf accessibility product
2. **Test** - [PinkFlow](link) validates accessibility standards
3. **Qualify** - [PinkFlowAI](link) validates AI models
4. **Deploy** - Containerized & deployed to [DeafOS](link)
5. **Access** - [DeafAUTH](link) provides SSO across all services
6. **Govern** - Vote on proposals in Municipal DAO

## What is Municipal DAO?

Municipal DAO is the **governance layer** for the MBTQ ecosystem. 
Once your deaf accessibility product passes qualification and 
deploys to DeafOS, users gain voting rights to shape the 
ecosystem's future.
